**Phase 1: JavaScript Code Challenges**



This Repository has a collection of basic Javascript coding challenges that are part of phase 1 part of my learning journey
it focuses on the basics of Javascript concepts like variables, data types, operators, conditional statements and the use of prompt() and console.log()

**The challenges Included.**

**1.Chai Ingredients Calculator:**
**Description**: This is a simple calculator that determines the required amounts on water, milk, tea leaves and sugar according to the number of cups the user keys in based on the standard recipe.
**Key Concepts** User input (prompt()), number conversion (Number()), basic arithmetic operations, console.log() for output, input validation (isNaN()).

**2. Boda Fare Estimator:**
****Description:** This is  a system that estimates the amount of money that a customer will pay to travel by a motorbike. The fare accumulates according to the number of kilometers traveled and the base fare.  
**Key Concepts:** User input (prompt()), number conversion (Number()), basic arithmetic operations, console.log() for output, input validation (isNaN()).

**3. Mobile Money Transaction Fee Estimator**
**Description:** This is a tool to estimate the transaction fee for sending money via a mobile money service. It, includes a minimum fee of KES 10 and a maximum fee of KES 70, ensuring the fee is always within these bounds.
**Key Concepts:** User input (prompt()), number conversion, if-else if-else conditional statements for complex logic.

**Technologies Used**
**JavaScript:** The core programming language for all challenge solutions.
**Web Browser **(for prompt()/console.log()): Can be used to run and test scripts directly in the browser's developer console.
**Setup**

To run these projects locally, follow these steps:
Clone this repository:

Bash

git clone git@github.com:FrancisKarani14/code-challenge-1.git
Then, navigate into the cloned directory:

Bash

cd code-challenge-1
Node.js (Optional, for terminal execution):
If you plan to run the scripts directly in your terminal using Node.js (rather than the browser console), ensure Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from nodejs.org.

Navigate into the respective challenge folder (e.g., cd chaiCalculator).
Initialize a Node.js project (if not already done for that specific folder):
Bash

You have two primary ways to run these JavaScript challenges:
2. Using Node.js in Your Terminal (Requires Node.js installed)
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the specific challenge folder you want to run (e.g., cd chaiCalculator).
If you modified the script to use readline-sync for input, ensure you've installed it as described in the "Setup and Installation" section.
Run the script using the node command:
Bash

node chai.js
# or
node fare.js
# or
node fee.js
The script will execute in your terminal, prompting for input and displaying output there.
