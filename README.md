**Phase 1: JavaScript Code Challenges**
This Repository has a collection of basic Javascript coding challenges that are part of phase 1 part of my learning journey
it focuses on the basics of Javascript concepts like variables, data types, operators, conditional statements and the use of prompt() and console.log()

**The challenges Included.**

**1.Chai Ingredients Calculator:**
**Description**: This is a simple calculator that determines the required amounts on water, milk, tea leaves and sugar according to the number of cups the user keys in based on the standard recipe.
**Key Concepts** User input (prompt()), number conversion (Number()), basic arithmetic operations, console.log() for output, input validation (isNaN()).

**2. Boda Fare Estimator:**
****Description:** This is  a system that estimates the amount of money that a customer will pay to travel by a motorbike. The fare accumulates according to the number of kilometers traveled and the base fare.  
**Key Concepts:** User input (prompt()), number conversion (Number()), basic arithmetic operations, console.log() for output, input validation (isNaN()).

**3. Mobile Money Transaction Fee Estimator**
**Description:** This is a tool to estimate the transaction fee for sending money via a mobile money service. It, includes a minimum fee of KES 10 and a maximum fee of KES 70, ensuring the fee is always within these bounds.
**Key Concepts:** User input (prompt()), number conversion, if-else if-else conditional statements for complex logic.

**Technologies Used**
**JavaScript:** The core programming language for all challenge solutions.
**Web Browser **(for prompt()/console.log()): Can be used to run and test scripts directly in the browser's developer console.
